Types of variables with respect to their scope:

    There are three types of variables w.r.t their scope.
    1) local variables.
    2) instance variables.
    3) static variables.
Local variables:

    A variables that is created inside a method loop switch case or any block of code is called local variable.
When we should use local variables:
    Local variables occupy the computers memory for the shortest amount of time. We should always go with
    local variables if it is possible.
    for(int i=0; i<5;i++){
    System.out.println(i);
    }

Instance variables:
    Which are declared outside a block of code but inside a class are called instance variables.
static variables:
    if an instance variable has a keyword static is called a static variable.
